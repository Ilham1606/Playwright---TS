## 🆘 QUICK HELP

**Tests don't run?**
- Ensure `.spec.ts` files exist in `src/tests/`
- Run `npm test` locally first

**Workflow doesn't trigger?**
- Ensure `.github/workflows/playwright.yml` is committed
- Check GitHub Actions is enabled

**Reports not found?**
- Wait for workflow to complete (10-15 min)
- Check workflow succeeded (green checkmark)
- Wait 30s, then refresh
